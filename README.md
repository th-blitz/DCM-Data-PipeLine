# DCM-Data-PipeLine
- As my ```final year``` project designed and implemented an algorithm to enhance the visibility of ```Liver tumor metabolism```.
- Curated datasets of over ```50``` patients collected from two cancer institutes in collaboration with our college.
- Built the ```dcm-data-pipeline``` to store and pre-process DICOM datasets.
